// wallit.  Right now the USPV package conforms to this interface, but it
// should also be possible to plug in things like fullnode-rpc clients, and
// (yuck) trusted block explorers.

/*  The model here is that the wallit has lots of state on disk about
what it's seen.  The ChainHook is ephemeral, and has some state in RAM but
shouldn't have to keep track of too much; or at least what it keeps track of
is internal and not exported out to the wallit (eg a fullnode keeps track
of a lot, and SPV node, somewhat less, and a block explorer shim basically nothing)
