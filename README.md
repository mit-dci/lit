# lit - a lightning node you can run on your own

![Lit Logo](litlogo145.png)

[![Build Status](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-prod/job/master/badge/icon)](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-prod/job/master/) (master)

(or [PR builds](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-PR-ng/view/change-requests/))

Under development, not for use with real money.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

* make

* (Optional, Windows) [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html)

* (Optional, for full test suite) Python 3 + `requests` library from PyPI

### Downloading

Clone the repo from git 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-dci/lit
cd lit
```
or `go get` it
```go
go get -v github.com/mit-dci/lit
```

### Installation

#### Linux, macOS, Cygwin, etc.

You can either use Go's built-in dependency management and build tool
```go
cd {GOPATH}/src/github.com/mit-dci/lit
go get -v ./...
go build
```
or use the Makefile
```bash
make # or make all
```

To run the python integration tests (which requires `bitcoind`), run `make test with-python=false`

#### Windows

Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) and follow the setup instructions or download prebuilt binaries from [Jenkins](http://hubris.media.mit.edu:8080/job/lit-prod/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/_releasedir/).

1. Make sure that environmental variable `%GOPATH%` is initizlized correctly.

2. Download required dependencies and then build with:

```
go get -v ./...
cd %GOPATH%\src\github.com\mit-dci\lit
go build -v .
go build -v .\cmd\lit-af
```

### Running lit

The below command will run Lit on the Bitcoin testnet3 network

(Note: Windows users should take off `./` but need to change `lit` to `lit.exe`)

```bash
./lit --tn3 localhost
```

The words `yup, yes, y, true, 1, ok, enable, on` can be used to specify that Lit
automatically connect to peers fetched from a list of DNS seeds, although you
probably want to connect it to an already-trusted node, like a local one.

### Packaging

You can make an archive package for any distribution by doing:

```
./build/releasebuild.sh <os> <arch>
```

and it will be placed in `build/_releasedir`.  It should support any OS that
Go and lit's dependencies support.  In place of `windows` use `win` and
in place of `386` use `i386`.

You can also package for Linux, macOS, and Windows in both amd64 and
i386 architectures by running `make package`. (NOTE: macOS is amd64 only)

Running `./build/releasebuild.sh clean` cleans the directories it generates.

## Command line arguments

When starting lit, the following command line arguments are available.  The
following commands may also be specified in `lit.conf` which is automatically
generated on startup with `tn3=1` by default.

#### Connecting to networks

| Arguments                   | Details                                                      | Default Port  |
| --------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------| ------------- |
| `--tn3 <nodeHostName>`      | connect to `nodeHostName`, which is a bitcoin testnet3 node. | 18333         |
| `--reg <nodeHostName>`      | connect to `nodeHostName`, which is a bitcoin regtest node.  | 18444         |

### Hierarchy of packages

One instance of lit has one litNode (package qln).

LitNodes manage lndc connections to other litnodes, manage all channels, rpc listener, and the ln.db.  Litnodes then initialize and contol wallits.

A litNode can have multiple wallits; each must have different params.  For example, there can be a testnet3 wallit, and a regtest wallit.  Eventually it might make sense to support a root key per wallit, but right now the litNode gives a rootPrivkey to each wallet on startup.  Wallits each have a db file which tracks utxos, addresses, and outpoints to watch for the upper litNode.  Wallits do not directly do any network communication.  Instead, wallits have one or more chainhooks; a chainhook is an interface that talks to the blockchain.

One package that implements the chainhook interface is uspv.  Uspv deals with headers, wire messages to fullnodes, filters, and all the other mess that is contemporary SPV.

(in theory it shouldn't be too hard to write a package that implements the chainhook interface and talks to some block explorer.  Maybe if you ran your own explorer and authed and stuff that'd be OK.)
